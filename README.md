### Configuration Basics

Edit the `config.properties` file to customize:

```properties
# Network settings
proxy.port=25565
proxy.host=0.0.0.0
proxy.online-mode=true

# Backend servers (comma-separated)
backend.servers=127.0.0.1:25566

# Security settings
firewall.enabled=true
max.connections=10
rate-limit=1000
```

### How to Run
1. Build the proxy as described above.
2. Edit `config.properties` to match your environment and backend servers.
3. Start the proxy with:
   ```sh
   java -jar target/original-douch-proxy-1.0.0-shaded.jar
   ```
4. Connect your Minecraft client to the proxy's IP and port (as set in `config.properties`).

**Note:**
- The proxy must be restarted to apply configuration changes.
- All backend Paper servers should be configured in `config.properties` and should not be run with their own proxy plugins (like BungeeCord or Velocity plugins).

## Plugin Development
Douch Proxy provides a standalone API for plugin and integration development. The API is available as a Maven dependency via JitPack:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.Listedroot</groupId>
  <artifactId>DouchAPI</artifactId>
  <version>v1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

- **Plugin Lifecycle:** Implement `Plugin` interface with `onEnable`, `onDisable`, etc.
- **Event System:** Listen for player join/quit, server switch, command registration, proxy ping, and chat events. All events implement `getTimestamp()` and `getName()`. Use `EventPriority` and `EventBusImpl` for advanced event handling.
- **Command Registration:** Register custom commands via the API.
- **Context Access:** Access proxy internals (config, logger, scheduler, etc.) via `PluginContext`.
- **Example Plugins:** See [DouchAPI README](https://github.com/Listedroot/DouchAPI#readme) for usage and examples.
